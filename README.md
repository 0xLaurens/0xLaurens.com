This is a personal portfolio site created as a hobby project in 2022. The project is intended to be a display of some of the work I have completed and to possibly generate new partnerships.

The project is fully designed and coded by me. The design of the website was done in figma to generate a basic concept of the site I would develop.

Visit the site at [0xLaurens.com](https://0xLaurens.com)
