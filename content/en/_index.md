Hi! I'm a Software Engineering student at [Avans Breda](https://avans.nl). My primary interests lie in back-end development and distributed systems.

I love tinkering with new technologies and deepening my understanding of how systems work. In addition to my studies, I enjoy coding personal projects, bouldering, and creating my own clothes.
