        "description": "The web app is an app created for elderly to motivate them to become more active. The app consisted of a UI for the elderly to use during the route within the forest and an admin panel which allowed the administrator to edit and preview the alterations live. The role I had in the project was designing the admin panel and integrating the reactivity of our vue application for a better user experience. In the project I also designed the techstack for the application which suited the needs of our product owner, the stack consisted of vue.js + vuetify + Firebase. During the project the scrum process was followed, we had a product owner and scrum master.",
